Legacy WPF application that was used to get a list of builds from the Team Foundation Server.

TFS has been replaced by Azure DevOps, so this is now assumed legacy code. Saved to Github for storage and posterity in case it helps anyone.

See Global.cs for default company name that will be used to form TFS url.

Note: this probably needs a large update as it's years out of date now.
