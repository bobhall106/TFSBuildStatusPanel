Simple list of things to keep track of what to do...
====================================================

Todo:
(MikeV) capturing some build timings which breakdown the times of the various components in a build e.g.  Oracle Update, SQL Server Update, etc. (Mike looking at more info to scrape)
(Bob) Code churn report concept
(Bob) Some simple display of build errors in new tab
(Bob) get the failed unit tests in new tab
(Bob) show checkin times volume on graph with colour on build status at that time, so we can see volume of checkins and the effect on builds status
(PN) schedule view of past builds
Done:
(SG) past builds shows anomaly running build for 300000mins(DEV and Dev-ebs-installer3-rebuild)
(BH) Better button highlighting in left pane when focus is elsewhere
(SA) be smarter about tfs queries based on dates, only get new data rather than everything every time
(Bob) Add favourites concept so you can mix and match branch builds, i.e. No Deploys from different branches for QA
^^^^^^previous relase build^^^^^^
Bug that showed multiple duplicate runnining builds
Bug that showed last changeset from previous build in current build
You can now distinguish between a queued build waiting for controller and one actually doing something
Queued builds now show differently colour to running builds
Sorting of main list view especially Favoutites list so branches are together
Separation of mainlist view into separate class
Bottom left panel update on timer if is the selected running build.
New Build Summary tab showing the live/completed build status log file
